## As you know, Spark requires numeric data for modeling. So far this hasn't been an issue; even boolean columns can easily be converted to integers without any trouble. But you'll also be using the airline and the plane's destination as features in your model. These are coded as strings and there isn't any obvious way to convert them to a numeric data type.

## Fortunately, PySpark has functions for handling this built into the pyspark.ml.features submodule. You can create what are called 'one-hot vectors' to represent the carrier and the destination of each flight. A one-hot vector is a way of representing a categorical feature where every observation has a vector in which all elements are zero except for at most one element, which has a value of one (1).

## Each element in the vector corresponds to a level of the feature, so it's possible to tell what the right level is by seeing which element of the vector is equal to one (1).

A one-hot vector is a way of representing a categorical feature where every observation has a vector in which all elements are zero except for at most one element, which has a value of one (1).

#Each element in the vector corresponds to a level of the feature, so it's possible to tell what the right level is by seeing which element of the vector is equal to one (1).

#The second step is to encode this numeric column as a one-hot vector using a OneHotEncoder. This works exactly the same way as the StringIndexer by creating an Estimator and then a Transformer. The end result is a column that encodes your categorical feature as a vector that's suitable for machine learning routines!

#This may seem complicated, but don't worry! All you have to remember is that you need to create a StringIndexer and a OneHotEncoder, and the Pipeline will take care of the rest.


# Create a StringIndexer
carr_indexer = StringIndexer(inputCol="carrier", outputCol="carrier_index")

# Create a OneHotEncoder
carr_encoder = OneHotEncoder(inputCol="carrier_index", outputCol="carrier_fact")

# Create a StringIndexer
dest_indexer = StringIndexer(inputCol="dest", outputCol="dest_index")

# Create a OneHotEncoder
dest_encoder = OneHotEncoder(inputCol="dest_index", outputCol"dest_fact")

## The last step in the Pipeline is to combine all of the columns containing our features into a single column. This has to be done before modeling can take place because every Spark modeling routine expects the data to be in this form. You can do this by storing each of the values from a column as an entry in a vector. Then, from the model's point of view, every observation is a vector that contains all of the information about it and a label that tells the modeler what value that observation corresponds to.

#Because of this, the pyspark.ml.feature submodule contains a class called VectorAssembler. This Transformer takes all of the columns you specify and combines them into a new vector column.


# Make a VectorAssembler
vec_assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=["month", "air_time", "carrier_fact", "dest_fact", "plane_age"], outputCol="features")

## Pipeline is a class in the pyspark.ml module that combines all the Estimators and Transformers that you've already created. This lets you reuse the same modeling process over and over again by wrapping it up in one simple object. Neat, right?

# Import Pipeline
from pyspark.ml import Pipeline

# Make the pipeline
flights_pipe = Pipeline(stages=[dest_indexer, dest_encoder, carr_indexer, carr_encoder, vec_assembler])

# Fit and transform the data
piped_data = flights_pipe.fit(model_data).transform(model_data)


## Use the DataFrame method .randomSplit() to split piped_data into two pieces, training with 60% of the data, and test with 40% of the data by passing the list [.6, .4] to the .randomSplit() method.

# Split the data into training and test sets
training, test = piped_data.randomSplit([.6, .4])
